üìä AWS Lambda - Read CSV from S3 using Pandas
This project demonstrates how to build a serverless data ingestion pipeline using AWS Lambda to read a CSV file from an S3 bucket and process it using pandas. The CSV data is read from S3, converted into a pandas DataFrame using io.StringIO, and logged or further processed inside the Lambda function.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills and AWS Services Used
AWS Lambda Trigger: S3 trigger configured to invoke the Lambda function automatically on file upload.

Lambda Layers: Used to include the pandas library and its dependencies.

IAM Permissions: Lambda execution role configured with the necessary permissions to access the S3 bucket (s3:GetObject).

CloudWatch Logs: Used to monitor function output, errors, and debug logs.

Boto3: AWS SDK for Python used to interact with S3 from within Lambda.

Pandas: For structured data processing and analysis.

io.StringIO: To convert string data into a file-like object readable by pandas.read_csv().
